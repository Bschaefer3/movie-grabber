# Movie Grabber


### Problem Statement

>"Hope rises like a phoenix from the ashes of shattered dreams." 
> -S. A. Sachs

Currently there is no API that tells the user which streaming service has which movies.
Currently almost none of the streaming services have an API that allows
people to determine which movies are available.
Movie Grabber is an API that will solve those problems and allow a user to 
determine where they can watch their movies and for what price.
